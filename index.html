Welcome to my podcast. To be completely honest, I have no idea what it's about yet (this website was made in advance). 
Moreover, I am probably still working out what I want to talk about anyways. And even more honestly, 
this website is mostly practice for me to learn how to code. 
For now, I will be planning out the various podcasts 
I wish to make and their topics.
